## Assignment 1: The workflow

Due by 11:59 pm Sunday, Sept. 8th.

### Overview
This assignment is aimed to give you practice with the [project workflow](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) with RStudio that we will be using throughout this course.
This should go smoothly, but if you run into any issues, we should be able to get them worked out.

You will be submitting three items: 1) a README.md, 2) an R Markdown report, and 3) a reflection.

#### Evaluation

The rubrics used for this assignment are:

### Create Your `hw01` Repo

GitHub Classroom will automatically make a repository for you, called `hw02-your_github_username`, for you to work on your assignment.
Follow these instructions to get the repo:

1. Sign-in to [Bb](https://mybb.gvsu.edu)
2. Go to the **hw01** assignment page (Assignments/hw01).

Here, you will find a url leading to a page on GitHub Classroom.
Visit this page and follow the instructions.  When you obtain your repository, it should contain a copy of this `.md` file and a blank `README.md` file.

#### 1. Edit `README.md` 

Your task here is to edit the `README.md` file in your repository to contain a sampler of GitHub-flavored markdown features.

1. The beginning of any README should contain a very brief description as to what the repo is, so that an unknown visitor landing on the repo can orient themselves
You should also help the visitor navigate your repository (in whatever way you think is most appropriate).
2. This README should contain an introduction to yourself.
Here you should elaborate and showcase various GitHub-flavored markdown features.

Remember the resources you were directed to view in your pre-course work.
These are also organized in the [Additional Resources/Markdown](/resources/markdown/) section of this site.

**FYI, this will be a public repo.**

#### 2. Exploration with R Markdown

Make an R Markdown document that explores a dataset, similar to the [gapminder](/learningmodules/lm1/rstudio_rmarkdown/activity0102) exploration seen in class.
You do not need an extensive exploration here, but your final submission should include both text and code intertwined.
If you mimiced (but less verbatim) the in-class activity, that would be considered *sufficient*.
You can use the gapminder data again, or choose a new R dataset.

Render your R Markdown to the `github_document` output format.
Commit both the `.Rmd` and `.md` files and push them to GitHub.
Give this a meaningful name, such as `hw01_your_dataset_name.Rmd` (which will produce a companion file, `hw01_your_dataset_name.md`).

#### 3. Reflection
  
After you have completed (1) and (2) above, go back to the **hw01** assignment page (Assignments/hw01) at [Bb](https://mybb.gvsu.edu).
You will submit your reflection here that minimally includes:

- A link to your homework repository
- A description of how you got the changes into README.md on GitHub
    - Did you use the browser at github.com?
    - Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?
- How did working on the R Markdown document go?
- Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you came across and how you solved them (helpful tutorials you read, etc.)
