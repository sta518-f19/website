#### Classroom

I fully believe that success in this course is possbile for each of you, but it does not come without an investment in time, energy, and attention.
I expect that you will do the following:

- Attend class meetings and participate actively in class and your teams.
- Stay connected with the course outside of class time through office hour visits and discussion board issues.
- Avoid procrastination and academic dishonesty.
- Take the initiative and ask for help when your efforts come up short, but strive to resolve questions and issues yourself first.
- Be committed to a [Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ).

My primary responsibility is to create a place where it is safe to take risks and make mistakes, without judgement, and provide you with feedback and guidance as you grow in your understanding of the subject.
Therefore, as my sutdents, you have the right to expect from me:

- Thoughtfully designed learning activities in and out of class.
- Informative, timely feedback on all graded work.  I strive to return all graded work by the next time that I see you after you turned it in.
- Respectful, professional treatment in all personal interactions.
- Timely responses to all communication.

If you feel that I am falling short of these expectations, you have the right and responsibility to give constructive feedback that helps me improve.
I will consider all reasonable suggestions in the course regarding my instruction or the course design.

#### Technology

In our face-to-face class meeting, please use whatever technology helps you learn.
The only restriction is that you do not engage in behavior that distracts others from learning.
Additionally, we will use Blackboard(Bb), git/GitHub, and R/R Studio.

##### Blackboard Site

The [Bb](https://mybb.gvsu.edu) course site will be used for announcements, submitting assignments, and grades.

##### git/GitHub

We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) extensively throughout this course for documents, assignments, and discussions.
Though we will have access to [git](https://git-scm.com/) through R Studio Cloud, you may choose to install it on your personal machine.

##### R/R Studio

[R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) are available to us through the [Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
Again, you may choose to install these on your personal machine.

#### Attendance

While attendance is not directly a grading component, it will impact your ability to complete the [Team Activity Labs](/syllabus/grading/#activity-labs) and may influence how your team members complete the peer evaluations.
Attendance, of course, is a crucial component of the course as later course concepts build on earlier ones.
When you are here, you can benefit from and contribute to team discussions and Activity Labs.
If you know that you will miss one of these days, it is your responsibility to communicate this to me and your team members in writing prior to the day you will miss class.

#### Getting Help

All course discussion will be through GitHub on the STA 418\\518 [discussion](https://github.com/sta518/discussion) repo.
This is a public discussion forum so others outside of the course can stumble upon it and help you as well.

I will be available to assist you, but your peers will also be a great resource.
Therefore, I encourage you to seek help in ways that are visible to others.

Some general advice for opeing an Issue on GitHub:

- First search existing issues (open and closed) for answers.
  If the question already has been answered, you're done!
  Feel free to open a closed issues if you believe the answer is not satisfactory.
- Give your issue an informative title:
  - Good: 'Error: could not find find function "ggplot"'
  - Bad: "I need help!", "Things not working", "aaaaaarrrrrgh!"
    Note that you can edit an issue's title after it has been posted.
- Format your questions using markdown and code formatting.
  Preview your issue prior to posting.
- Where appropriate, provide links to specific files (or lines within them) in the body of your issue.
  This will help your helper understand your question.
  Note that only I have access to private repos.
- (Optional) Tag someone or a group of people.
  Start by typing the @ symbol and GitHub will generate some good suggestions.
  You can also type of paste in the GitHub username yourself.
  Examples: to tag me, use `@dykesb`; to tag a class/team mate use their GitHub username.
- Click on **Submit new issue** when you are ready to post.

Don't just create Issues, also respond to them!
Your experience might have some valuable insight to add to the conversation; it doesn't have to be in terms of "correctness".

You may prefer to get your questions answered in person.
Make use of my [office hours](/syllabus/about/#instructor-information), I am here to help!
You are welcome to drop in during posted office hours, either individually or with friends, or you can schedule an appointmnet.
Office hours are an excellent opportunity for you to ask questions about projects, assignments, graduate school, research opportunities, or careers in statistics.

You can ask questions about anything at any time without judgment.
I want to help you succeed.

#### Academic Dishonesty

From [Student Code, Section 4](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774&search=): 

> Academic dishonesty is defined as actions or behaviors that misrepresent oneâ€™s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination. 

It is ok if you get stuck on an assignment in this course.
This will happen to everyone, multiple times, and it is a sign that you are learning.
There are, however, proper methods for [getting help](/syllabus/policies/#getting-help) to guide you through your difficulties.

What can academic dishonesty look like?

- Copying or paraphrasing another student's work
- Copying or paraphrasing from a print or online resource
- Allowing another student to copy or paraphrase your work.

Many of you are under a lot of stress and at some point during the semester, you may feel tempted to take part in academic dishonesty.
I want you to succeed in this course and you have a network of peers in the class to help.
Also, the [Revisions and Resubmission](/syllabus/grading/#revision-and-reassessment) policy states that it is fine to turn in work that is not perfect.
Do the best that you can, get feedback, and you can revise it later.

With the huge amount of code available online (e.g., StackOverflow), it is ok to use these resources to help solve any of the problems encountered in class - unless I explicitly tell you not to use something.
If you do this, you **must** cite where you obtained it when you use it (or use as an inspiration).

Violations of this policy will automatically result in an "Unsatisfactory" grade and possible futher measures spelled out in the [Student Code](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774&search=#procedures).

#### Inclement Weather 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/4bp0rxBHTorTO/giphy.gif)

In the event that a school closing would impact a specified final exam day, those exams affected would be held on the next available day after the exam week has concluded.
For example - if a Tuesday exam day were canceled, the next available day after the conclusion of the exam week would be Saturday.  If two exam days were affected, i.e. Wednesday and Thursday, Wednesday's exam would take place on Saturday and Thursday's exam would be the following Monday.

If a school closing impacts a regular class meeting, I will send an annoucement through email of what you are expected to have prepared for the next class meeting.

#### Statement on Disability Accommodations

Any student who requires accommodation because of a physical or learning disability must contact [Disability Support Resources](http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr) at <a href="+16163312490">(616) 331-2490</a> as soon as possible.
After you have documented your disability through DSR, please make an appointment to see me to discuss your specific needs.

#### Changes to the Syllabus

I reserve the right to make reasonable changes to the syllabus during the semester.
If it makes sense to, I will seek student input prior to making them.
All changes will be announced through course announcements and in face-to-face meetings.

#### GVSU Policies

This course is subject to GVSU's [Course Policies](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies).
