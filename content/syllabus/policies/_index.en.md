### Course Policies

#### Attendance

Attendance is not directly a grading component, but it may influence how your team members complete your peer evaluations.  Attendance, of course, is a crucial component of the TBL classroom.  When you are here, you can benefit from and contribute to team discussions and application activities.  I-RATs, T-RATs, and Exams must be completed in-class on the day they are done.  If you know that you will miss one of these days, it is your responsibility to communicate this to me by email or in writing (not texting) prior to the day you will miss class.

##### What to Do If You are Absent

Attendance is a crucial component of the TBL classroom.  When you are here, you can benefit from and contribute to team discussions and the application activities.  Also, attendance is very important as later course concepts build on earlier ones.  Further, your being gone may leave a negative impression on your team members when it comes to peer evaluations.

I-RATs, T-RATs, and exams are to be completed in-class on the day they are administered.  Still, I realize that, at times, absences are unavoidable.  If you know you will be absent on one of the days during which an I-RAT or T-RAT will be administered, it is your responsibility to communicate this to me by email or in writing (not texting) prior to the missed class so alternate arrangements can be made.  If you are absent – due to unexpected circumstance – on one of the days during which an I-RAT or T-RAT was administered, it is your responsibility to initiate communication with me by email or in writing (not texting) as soon as possible after the missed class to determine if you will be able make up the missed assessment.  Permission will be sought from the team members present for the T-RAT to award a missing team member the team T-RAT score (there must be unanimous consent for this to occur).  See “Examinations” section under “Explanation of Certain Grading Components” for additional information regarding a missed examination.   

Further, if you miss class, you are responsible for all announcements made and materials covered in class.  Connect with your team members to get caught up.  After you’ve reviewed these notes, I am happy to provide any needed clarification.  See the “Homework” section under “Explanation of Certain Grading Components” regarding the acceptance of late-submission homework.


#### Course Technology

##### Blackboard Site

The [Bb](https://mybb.gvsu.edu) course site will be used for announcements and the sharing of course materials.
You should get in the habit of checking the course site regularly – at least once daily.
Grades will also be maintained via Bb.

##### Computing and Software



#### Inclement Weather 

##### Closing During Class Sessions



##### Closing During Final Exams

In the event that a closing would involve a specified exam day, those exams affected would be held on the next available day after the exam week has concluded.
For example - if a Tuesday exam day were canceled, the next available day after the conclusion of the exam week would be Saturday.  If two exam days were affected, i.e. Wednesday and Thursday, Wednesday's exam would take place on Saturday and Thursday's exam would be the following Monday.

#### Classroom/Computer Lab Conduct/Policies

- Ask a lot of questions as we cover topics in class; use my office hours for additional clarification as needed
- Stay on task and be engaged during class; offer answers to posed questions and discuss concepts with your peers
- Print out any assigned materials in advance of the class (remember to check Bb for announcements regularly); printing materials at the start of class is disruptive for all
- Practice doing calculations on your calculator with activities and homework; performing calculations for the first time on an exam is seldom a good idea
- Arrive to class on time to avoid interrupting others
- Have homework and other individual assignments ready to turn in (i.e., have your name on the assignment and multiple pages stapled together) at the start of class when it is due
- During class, turn off your cell phone or put it on vibrate.  Students whose cell phones ring during class will be expected to bring cookies (or a similar treat) to the next class period (white chocolate macadamia nut cookies … Mmmmmm!)
- On some days, despite meeting in the computer lab, we may not use computers at all or only for a portion of the class.  If we are not using the computers for a STA 216-related purpose, please do not use the computers during class – as this is tremendously disruptive for others
- When we use computers for a STA 216-related purpose, stay on task (i.e. don’t surf the web, check Facebook, etc.); you’re paying for your class time – use it wisely!
- For your protection, I will not discuss grades via email; such discussions need to take place face-to-face
- Be aware of some of my “pet peeves”
  - “I was gone on [insert day].  Did we cover anything important?”
  - “I will be gone on [insert day].  Are we going to cover anything important?”
  - “I have a quick question.”
  - “I have a stupid/silly question.”
  - “Are you going to be in your office during your office hours?”
  - Pie charts!


### GVSU Policies

This course is subject to [GVSU's policies](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies).
In addition, please be aware of the following:  

#### Statement on Disability Accommodations

Any student who requires accommodation because of a physical or learning disability must contact Disability Support Resources (http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr; 616-331-2490) as soon as possible.
After you have documented your disability through DSR, please make an appointment to see me to discuss your specific needs.  

#### Academic Honesty

From [Student Code, Section 4](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774&search=): 

> Academic dishonesty is defined as actions or behaviors that misrepresent one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination. 

**So what does this mean?**

You are expected to conduct yourself with the highest standards of academic honesty.
EXAMINATIONS ARE TO BE COMPLETED INDEPENDENTLY.
Acts such as cheating (e.g., having someone else complete your i-RAT/exam, providing answers on an i-RAT/exam to another student, unauthorized possession of an in-class examination (including a RAT), divulging questions on an in-class examination (including a RAT) to students who have not yet taken the examination, seeing or hearing examination (or RAT) questions which you have not yet taken, letting someone copy your answer(s) to exam question(s) (including RATs) and/or homework answer(s), etc.) and plagiarism (e.g., copying work from someone else and representing it as your own) will not be tolerated and are grounds for disciplinary actions.
Consequences for any and/or all of such acts may include: (1) a failing grade for that particular assignment or examination, (2) a failing grade for the course, (3) suspension from the university, and/or (4) expulsion from the university.
