##### Meeting Preparation

To be completed prior to class either individually or with your team.
These will introduce you to new material and have you do some initial learning so we can spend class time focusing on the more difficult concepts.

#### Individual Portfolio

Throughout the course you will supply evidence of your individual learning.


##### Application Tasks

These tasks will have you apply the concepts to a larger data analysis task beyond what is covered in class during the activity labs.

##### Midterm Projects

There are two take home projects that are to be completed individually.
Each project will have you complete a substantial computing task that applies the materials covered in class.
Each project will be submitted via a private GitHub repository and take you 2 - 5 hours to complete.
The exact content of these projects will be discussed before they are assigned.

#### Team Tasks

At the beginning of the couse, you will be assigned to a teams of 4-6 peers.
These will stay consistent throughout the semester.
Each of you will be asked to provide your team members feedback on their contributions a few times throughout the course.

##### Activity Labs

Labs are the "daily grind" of this course.
The objective here is to give you many hands on experiences using modern statistical software in varying data analysis tasks.
These data analysis tasks will provide you with the skills and tools to complete your team project.

All team members are expected to contribute equally on these labs.
You are expected to make use of git and GitHub as your central collaborative platform.
Commits to these will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab.

##### Team Project

You and your team members will be responsible for the completion of an open ended final course project.
The goal is to engage in a meaningful problem showcasing the tools and techniques you've developed throughout the course.
Each team's work will be shared with and evaluated by at least one other team at an earlier stage to provide feedback and/or suggestions.
Additional details will be provided as the semester progresses.

### Grading Specifications

We use a **mastery grading** system in STA 418\\518, where your course grade is determined by a collection of work that you will accumulate throughout the semester demonstrating your mastery of the course concepts.
Your work will be evaluated on whether or not it meets acceptable standards of quality.
Since points will not be awarded, ther is no partial credit; however, there will be opportunities to revise and resubmit work until you are happy with your grade on the task.
*Explain why revisions and resubmissions are important for computing and graphics.*

*Talk about how this will be different and possibly more complicated than they're used to, but ultimately they will have more control over their grade, less stress (due to more clear objectives and guidelines), and will reflect their effort and improvement.*

#### Revision and Reassessment

The grading system in this course insists that you show excellence in all assessments throughout the course.
However, I believe that learning is a continual process and it is ok to not fully understand the material when you first encounter it.
Therefore, if you are not happy with a grade that you earned on an assignment, you will have opportunities to try again and show excellence.
Here are how revisions and reassessments will work on the specific assessments throughout the course.

##### Application Tasks

Any Application Tasks earning a "Progressing" can be resubmitted by the end of the week (i.e., 11:59 pm EST on Saturday) that they were originally returned.
To resubmit an Application Task more than once, you will need to come talk to me during my [office hours](/syllabus/about/#instructor-information) or [schedule](mailto:dykesb@gvsu.edu) a meeting.

##### Midterm Projects

A Midterm Project that receives a "Progressing" or "Satisfactory" will ge given substantial instructor feedback.
You may use this feedback to revise and resubmit your work to raise the grade.
To revise a Midterm Project, first request a revision by [telling me](mailto:dykesb@gvsu.edu) you want one.
I will provide you with some additional questions asking you to reflect on your preparation and performance to the original submission.
You only need to complete only the portions you wish to revise, along with the additional questions and submit it again.

Only one of the Midterm Projects can earn an "Excellent" through revisions.
After the first "Excellent" Midterm Project grade through revisions, the highest grade possible for any further revised Midterm Project is "Satisfactory".
Specific items in a Midterm Project can still earn an "Excellent" through revisions, but the *overall* project grade will be capped at "Satisfactory".

#### How your course grade is determined

Your course grade is determined using two steps.
First, your **base grade** is determined using the requirements listed for each base grade below:

| To Earn | Do all of the following |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| A       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **both** Midterm Projects; earning at least one "Excellent" <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Activity Labs <br> - Earn "Excellent" on the Team Project |
| B       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **both** Midterm Projects <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Activity Labs <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on the Team Project |
| C       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **both** Midterm Projects <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Activity Labs <br> - Earn "Progressing" on the Team Project |
| D       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **at least one** Midterm Project <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least XX** Activity Labs |
| F       | Given if *all* of the requirements for a "D" are not met |

**Note**: These values are based on XX Application Tasks and XX Activity Labs.
If either of these counts change, the table above will be updated appropriately.

Once your base grade has been determined, a plus/minus distinction will be made using the following:

|                              |                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **plus** (+)       | You completed **at least XX** Meeting Preparations and did one of the following: <br> + You earned an "Excellent" on at least on Midterm Project; or <br> + You completed the Application Tasks requirements for the next higher grade; or <br> + Team Project requirements for the next higher grade. |
| **minus** (-)      | - You completed **fewer than XX** Meeting Preparations; or <br> - (For A grades only) You complete all the requirements for a base grade of “A” except the “Excellent” requirement for Midterm Projects. |

If neither of these rules apply to you, then your course grade is simply the base grade you earned.

**Note**:  I cannot award an "A+" or a "D-" since these grades do not exist at GVSU.
