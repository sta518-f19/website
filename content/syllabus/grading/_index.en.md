### Assignments and Grading Standards

We use a **mastery grading** system in STA 418\\518, where your course grade is determined by a collection of work that you will accumulate throughout the semester demonstrating your mastery of the course concepts.
Your work will be evaluated on whether or not it meets acceptable standards of quality.
Since points will not be awarded, ther is no partial credit; however, there will be opportunities to [revise and resubmit](/syllabus/grading/#revision-and-reassessment) work until you are 

Your grade in this course will reflect your effort and improvement.
It sometimes takes multiple attempts and new concepts to help previous material make sense.
This is probably a different and more complicated process than you are used to.
However, this is to provide you with more control over you grade and less stress.

#### Meeting Preparation

To be completed prior to class either individually or with your team.
These will introduce you to new material and have you do some initial learning so we can spend class time focusing on the more difficult concepts.

Meeting Preparation assignments are graded either **Satisfactory** (S) or **Unsatisfactory** (U) on the basis of completeness, effort, and timeliness.

| Mark      | Description      |
| --------- |:------ |
| **S**     | Every item has a good-faith effort to complete it and the work is submitted before the deadline. |
| **U**     | No work submitted; or work is submitted late, not complete, or at least one submission that is not a serious attempt. |

**Note**: Meeting Preparation does not need to be actually correct; mistakes are welcome as long as they are made honestly.

#### Individual Portfolio

Throughout the course you will supply evidence of your individual learning.

##### Application Tasks

These tasks will have you apply the concepts to a larger data analysis task beyond what is covered in class during the activity labs.

Application Tasks emphasize critical analysis and writing skills.
These tasks are evaluated not only on completeness and correctness, but also on sytle and efficiency and earn an overall grade of **Excellent** (E), **Satisfactory** (S), **Progressing** (P), or **Incomplete** (I).

| Mark      | Description      |
| --------- |:------ |
| **E**     | Exceeded the requirements in a number of dimensions.  Impressive use of the course tools - maybe involving functions, packages, or workflows that were not done in class materials.  Impeccable organization of repo and report. |
| **S**     | The work is complete and demonstrates correct methods discussed in class.  There may be a few isolated errors in writing, program, or other aspects of the task that do not affect the overall report.  Task is eash to read.  |
| **P**     | One or more elements are missing or incomplete.  Missed opportunites to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation.  Some techinical problems that are relatively easy to fix.  Difficult to find report. |
| **I**     | Many substantial gaps, ommisions, or errors; or, incomplete, incorrect, or difficult to read; or, report requires more than just a simple revision ;or, did not attempt.   |

##### Midterm Projects

There are two take home projects that are to be completed individually.
Each project will have you complete a substantial computing task that applies the materials covered in class.
Each project will be submitted via a private GitHub repository.
The exact content of these projects will be discussed before they are assigned.
Midterm Projects and the Team Project will be assessed using similar [rubrics](/syllabus/grading/#midterm-and-team-projects-grade-standards).

#### Team Portfolio

At the beginning of the couse, you will be assigned to a teams of 4-6 peers.
These will stay consistent throughout the semester.
Each of you will be asked to provide your team members feedback on their contributions a few times throughout the course.

##### Activity Labs

Labs are the "daily grind" of this course.
The objective here is to give you many hands on experiences using modern statistical software in varying data analysis tasks.
These data analysis tasks will provide you with the skills and tools to complete your team project.

All team members are expected to contribute equally on these labs.
You are expected to make use of git and GitHub as your central collaborative platform.
Commits to these will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab.

Activity Labs assignments are graded either **Satisfactory** (S) or **Progressing** (P) on the basis of completeness, effort, and timeliness.

| Mark      | Description      |
| --------- |:------ |
| **S**     | None of the lab tasks are left blank.  Labs are easy to access and code runs.  |
| **P**     | At least one lab task is blank; or, there are many errors causing the code to not run; or, not an earnest effort.  Needs revision, which can be done after further reflection. |

It is possible that an individual's grade differs from the teams grade.
This could be due to a class absence or lacking evidence of that individual's participation.

##### Team Project

You and your team members will be responsible for the completion of an open ended final course project.
The goal is to engage in a meaningful problem showcasing the tools and techniques you've developed throughout the course.
Each team's work will be shared with and evaluated by at least one other team at an earlier stage to provide feedback and/or suggestions.
Additional details will be provided as the semester progresses.
Midterm Projects and the Team Project will be assessed using similar [rubrics](/syllabus/grading/#midterm-and-team-projects-grade-standards).

##### Midterm and Team Projects Grade Standards

These larger projects will be graded on a evaluation of collective criteria.
Each project will specify which criterion are being assessed and you will earn a grade of **Excellent** (E), **Satisfactory** (S), **Progressing** (P), or **Incomplete** (I).

| Criterion | E      | S      | P      | I      |
| --------- |:------ |:------ |:------ |:------ |
| **Coding Style** | Coding manual is followed with meaningful comments | Code lacks refinement and has some errors, but is readable and has some comments | Partial understanding, but many errors in code and little attention paid to making the code human readable | Code requires more than just a simple revision; or, no attempt. |
| **Coding Strategy** | Task is broken down into sub-tasks that are individually much simpler.  Code is efficient, correct, and minimal.  Code uses appropriate data structure.  Code checks for common errors. | Code is correct, but could be edited down to be leaner.  While appropriate data structures aren't used, method works.  Some checks for common errors. | Code is presented in large complicated chunks.  Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized.  No error checks. | Strategy requires more than just a simple revision; or, no attempt. |
| **Presentation: Graph** | Graph(s) carefullly tuned for desired purpose.  Graph(s) effectively illustrate their point. | Graph(s) well chosen, but contain minor problems (e.g., poor labels or inappropriate aspect ratios) | Graph(s) are poorly chosen to support questions. | Graph(s) require more than a simple revision; or, missing. |
| **Presentation: Tables** | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to make important comparisons.  Styling highlights important features. | Table(s) are generally appropriate, but have some minor formatting issues. | Table(s) include too many or inconsistent decimal places; or, table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. | Tables(s) require more than a simple revision; or, missing. |
| **Creativity** | Report goes beyond what was expected and required (e.g., implements additional tools not addressed by this course or sophisticated application of tools from course.) | Tools and techniques from the course are effectively applied.  Chosen task was appropriate, but fairly conservative. | Attempts at using tools and techniques from the course, but incorrectly implemented. | Chosen task was limited in scope; or, no attempt. |
| **Ease of Access** | No issues with instructor accessing materials and code runs. | Minor issues with instructor accessing materials or running code. | There is an attempt to comply with course conventions for submitting work, but issues persit.  Can be improved with revision. | No effort to reduce friction; or code does not run. |

For each of these larger tasks you will earn an overall mark of either **Excellent** (E), **Satisfactory** (S), or **Progressing** (P).
These are generally earned as follows, but specific guidelines will be provided for each Midterm Project:

- **E**:  Each criterion earned an Excellent or a Satisfactory grade, including at least 50% of criteria earning Excellent.
- **S**: Each criterion earned an Excellent or a Satisfactory grade, including at least 25% of criteria earning Excellent.
- **P**: Earned at least one Progressing or Incomplete on a criterion.

### Revision and Reassessment

The grading system in this course insists that you show excellence in all assessments throughout the course.
However, I believe that learning is a continual process and it is ok to not fully understand the material when you first encounter it.
Therefore, if you are not happy with a grade that you earned on an assignment, you will have opportunities to try again and show excellence.

Here are how revisions and reassessments will work on the specific assessments throughout the course.

#### Meeting Preparation

No revisions are allowed for Meeting Preparation.

#### Application Tasks

Any Application Tasks earning a "Progressing" can be resubmitted by the end of the week (i.e., 11:59 pm EST on Saturday) that they were originally returned.
To resubmit an Application Task more than once, you will need to come talk to me during my [office hours](/syllabus/about/#instructor-information) or [schedule](mailto:dykesb@gvsu.edu) a meeting.

#### Midterm Projects

A Midterm Project that receives a "Progressing" or "Satisfactory" will be given substantial instructor feedback.
You may use this feedback to revise and resubmit your work to raise the grade.
To revise a Midterm Project, first request a revision by [telling me](mailto:dykesb@gvsu.edu) you want one.
I will provide you with some additional questions asking you to reflect on your preparation and performance to the original submission.
You only need to update the portions you wish to revise, along with the additional questions and submit it again.

Only one of the Midterm Projects can earn an "Excellent" through revisions.
After the first "Excellent" Midterm Project grade through revisions, the highest grade possible for any further revised Midterm Project is "Satisfactory".
Specific items in a Midterm Project can still earn an "Excellent" through revisions, but the *overall* project grade will be capped at "Satisfactory".

#### Activity Labs

Any lab earning a "Progressing" can be resubmitted by the team before the end of the week (i.e., 11:59 pm EST on Saturday) that they were submitted.
When you resubmit a lab, make sure to let me know so that I am aware.

If you individually received a "Progressing" and wish to revise and resubmit, you must talk to me during my [office hours](/syllabus/about/#instructor-information) or [schedule](mailto:dykesb@gvsu.edu) a meeting.
In this meeting we will talk about your preparation and performance.
Individuals are only allowed **one** resubmission.

#### Team Project

No revisions are allowed for the Team Project.

### How your course grade is determined

Your course grade is determined using two steps.
First, your **base grade** is determined using the requirements listed for each base grade below:

| To Earn | Do all of the following |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| A       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 90%** of Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **both** Midterm Projects; earning at least one "Excellent" <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 90%** of Activity Labs <br> - Earn "Excellent" on the Team Project |
| B       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 80%** of Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **both** Midterm Projects <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 80%** of Activity Labs <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on the Team Project |
| C       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 70%** of Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **both** Midterm Projects <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 70%** of Activity Labs <br> - Earn "Progressing" on the Team Project |
| D       | - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 50%** of Application Tasks <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" or "Excellent" on **at least one** Midterm Project <br> - Earn "Satisfactory" on **at least 50%** of Activity Labs |
| F       | Given if *all* of the requirements for a "D" are not met |

<!-- **Note**: These values are based on XX Application Tasks and XX Activity Labs.
If either of these counts change, the table above will be updated appropriately. -->

Once your base grade has been determined, a plus/minus distinction will be made using the following:

|                              |                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **plus** (+)       | You completed **at least XX** Meeting Preparations and did one of the following: <br> + You earned an "Excellent" on at least on Midterm Project; or <br> + You completed the Application Tasks requirements for the next higher grade; or <br> + Team Project requirements for the next higher grade. |
| **minus** (-)      | - You completed **fewer than XX** Meeting Preparations; or <br> - (For A grades only) You complete all the requirements for a base grade of “A” except the “Excellent” requirement for Midterm Projects. |

If neither of these rules apply to you, then your course grade is simply the base grade you earned.

**Note**:  I cannot award an "A+" or a "D-" since these grades do not exist at GVSU.
