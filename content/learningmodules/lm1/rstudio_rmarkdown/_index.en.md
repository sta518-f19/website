After completing these readings, students should be able to:

- Perform basic calculations in the R Console,
- Assign values to to objects using `<-`,
- Identify the default panes in RStudio, 
- Create a new R script to save and run your code, and
- Describe the benefits of using RStudio projects in your workflow.

In class we will apply these workflow strategies to an R markdown analysis that introduces Exploratory Data Analysis!

#### Meeting Preparation

**Time**: 60-75 mins

1. Complete the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) tutorial
  - [Snip](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027213/windows-10-open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot) (PC) or [Grab](https://support.apple.com/guide/grab/welcome/mac) (mac) (or whatever Linux does... ) the final "congratulations" screen
  - In the [discussion](https://github.com/sta518/discussion) repo, find the "Activity 1.2 Meeting Preparation" Issue created by Bradford `@dykesb` and respond to it.  
    - Attach your "congratulations" screen
    - Showcase some of your new skills (e.g., formatted text, inline code, hyperlinks, tag a classmate) or try some [gifs](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet#imagesgifs) or [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).
    - Click on "Comment" when youâ€™re done.
      To earn an **S** for this Meeting Preparation, you must include at least three (3) unique markdown skills and your image.
2. Sign-up for [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) with your GitHub credentials
  - Click on the "Get Started" button, then
  - Click on the "Sign up with GitHub" button.
  - **Note**: This is also linked on the toolbar of the course site (<i class='fas angle-right'></i> RStudio)
3. Read the following chapters of the Explore section in R4DS:
  - [Introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html)
  - [Workflow: basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html),
  - [Workflow: scripts](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html), and
  - [Workflow: projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

As you read through the chapters, practice the R code within an [RStudio Cloud Project](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide#projects) and work on the exercises at the end of each chapter.
The R community is extremely (and at times too) helpful so many of these exercises have [solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) available.
As such, these exercises will never be collected, but feel free to get help in the [discussion](https://github.com/sta518/discussion) repo.
